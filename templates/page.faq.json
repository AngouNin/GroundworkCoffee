            "desc": "<p>Organic is at the forefront of all we do at Groundwork Coffee, from buying only certified organic (i.e. pesticide-, herbicide-, fungicide-free) coffees to roasting those same coffees using our industry-leading, solar-powered technology. As one of the first Certified Organic coffee roasters in Southern California, we've been pioneering organic, relationship-based, and sustainable coffee sourcing since the early '90s. When it comes to pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides, coffee is the third-most sprayed agricultural crop in the world. Most major coffee producers coat their crops with a witches’ brew of toxic chemicals to fight intruders and increase crop yields. That said, the question is not whether these chemicals make their way into your morning cup. At peak temperatures above 450 degrees, the roasting process will most likely burn off any residual chemicals. The real question is, what do these chemicals do to the environment and communities where they are sprayed? The data is clear; the effects on groundwater, nearby crops, and people’s health are well documented. <\/p><p>In addition to being better for those growing our coffee, we believe that a commitment to organic simply produces better coffee. Without the advantage of herbicides, pesticides, and fungicides, coffee farmers have to take better care of their trees to experience the same quality and crop yields per tree as their non-organic competitors. Organic farmers have to choose viable soil and water sources in order to avoid adding synthetic nutrients later. They have to grow their coffee at higher altitudes, which dissuades many insects and parasitic plants, resulting in a slower-developing, more complex-flavored coffee bean. Organic farmers have to accept a trade-off of lower overall yield in exchange for a more biodiverse habitat. In return, coffee roasters and their customers pay them a premium to continue the practice. We think it’s money well spent..<\/p>",
